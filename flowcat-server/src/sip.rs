//! Generic SIP inbound/originate orchestration — the SIP analogue of the carrier
//! media-WS path (`media_ws` + [`run_call_with`](crate::run::run_call_with)).
//!
//! flowcat-core exposes the SIP *primitives* — [`SipAgent`], [`InboundInvite`],
//! `SipTransport` — but every embedder that wants inbound or outbound SIP otherwise
//! hand-writes the same loop around them: an inbound pump (`while let Some(invite) =
//! agent.next_inbound().await { … }`, then per-INVITE resolve → answer → run) and an
//! outbound originate (resolve → `agent.originate` → run detached). That loop is
//! identical across embedders; only "map a dialed identifier to a call" and the
//! per-call brain construction are embedder-specific — exactly the seams the WS path
//! already abstracts.
//!
//! This module is that loop, parameterised the same way the WS path is — over the
//! embedder's [`SessionSource`] + a [`BrainFactory`] + a [`TopologyConfig`] + a
//! [`SpecResolver`] (bundled into [`SipOrchestrator`]) —
//! plus one SIP-specific seam, [`SipInboundResolver`], that maps a dialed identifier
//! to the run it should drive (the analogue of the run id + token the media-WS URL
//! carries).
//!
//! - [`serve_sip_inbound`] — the inbound-INVITE pump: per INVITE, resolve the dialed
//!   identity → a [`SipRun`], build the brain, **answer**, and run the call via the
//!   same [`run_call_with`](crate::run::run_call_with) the WS path uses; **reject**
//!   the INVITE on any pre-answer error (fail-closed).
//! - [`sip_originate`] — the outbound driver: resolve the run's brain, dial, and run
//!   the answered call detached.
//!
//! Embedder-specific policy (how a DID maps to a run, destination/auth checks) lives
//! behind [`SipInboundResolver`] / the [`SessionSource`], mirroring how the WS path
//! keeps resolve + brain construction behind those seams. Gated behind
//! `server-helper` (framework glue, no connector bundle).
