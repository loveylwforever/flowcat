//! # flowcat-services
//!
//! Speech/LLM **service providers** for the Flowcat runtime: realtime
//! speech-to-speech, streaming STT, streaming TTS, context-driven LLM, the
//! networked observability **exporters**, and MCP-as-processor.
//!
//! These impl the service **traits frozen in
//! [`flowcat_core::service`]** (`SttService`/`TtsService`/`LlmService`/
//! `RealtimeLlmService`) + the [`flowcat_core::observer::FrameObserver`] seam.
//! flowcat-core never depends back on this crate (the forbidden core→sibling
//! edge); the traits live in core, the network-pulling impls live here.
//!
//! ## Note
//!
//! Every provider is behind its own `dep:`-gated Cargo feature (see
//! `Cargo.toml`), so a **default build compiles nothing but these module stubs**
//! — no `reqwest`/`tonic`/`tokio-tungstenite`/`whisper-rs`/`opentelemetry` is
//! pulled until a feature is enabled. Adding a provider fills the body of its
//! already-declared module; it never adds a `mod` decl or a dep line.
//!
//! **The Gemini realtime client stays in `flowcat-core`** (re-exported as
//! [`flowcat_core::GeminiLive`], imported directly by the embedder); only the
//! NEW realtime providers live here. Moving Gemini into this crate is deferred
//! (it would break the embedder's workspace build).
